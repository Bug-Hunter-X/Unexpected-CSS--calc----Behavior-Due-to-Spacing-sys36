The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, unexpected behavior can occur if there are spaces between the operators and values within the `calc()` function. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works as expected, but `width: calc( 100% - 20px );` might not, leading to unexpected widths or layout issues.
